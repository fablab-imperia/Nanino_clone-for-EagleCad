This project is inspired by Johan von Kono's Nanino and forked from a Mariolukas Eagle clone by FabLab Imperia.

We made some minor moves and added some clearance for easier milling, added the groundplane, a prototyping zone like the Nanino, some reference values and the text. 
Also, we made a similar "mini" version without prototyping zone and reducing the Dimension layer.
Next releases will follow the original version number. Revision number will reflect further improvements.

Feel free to use and modify.
